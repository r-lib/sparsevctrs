## CRAN notes

Apologies for making a re-submission so soon. We discivered a critical issue that needed to be fixed immediately.

- Fixed critical issue with `sparsity()` in dealing with classed numerics.
- Fixed "Additional Issues" for rchk check.
- I think the note/warning regarding knitr are false positives.
