The sparse vectors created with this package will act as a drop-in replacement for dense vectors in any workflow. You will not see a memory penalty for doing this. This is happening because non-compatible operations will simply materialize the full vector and it would behave as if you didn't create it sparse to begin with. 

This is generally the truth, but there are some cases where it isn't. This article will lay out when and how you can use sparse vectors for the best performance possible.

To aid users in determining whether the code is not dropping the sparsity, the option `sparsevctrs.verbose_materialize` can be set to alert the user that a sparse vector was forced to materialize.

```r
options("sparsevctrs.verbose_materialize" = TRUE)
```

## Base size of objects

One of the differences between sparse and dense vectors is how much memory they take up. This value is computed as an offset plus a linear effect based on the number of values.

An integer vector of length 0 takes up `48 B` to exist. Each additional value adds another `4 B` on average. This effect is linear, so an integer vector with 1000 elements takes up `48 B + 1000 * 4 B = 4048 B`, an integer vector with 2000 elements takes up `48 B + 2000 * 4 B = 8048 B` and so on.

```{r}
obj_size(integer(0))
obj_size(integer(1000))
obj_size(integer(2000))
obj_size(integer(3000))
```

The vectors above only contained the value `0`. We can replicate that sparsely with `sparse_integer(integer(), integer(), length = 0)`. We see that the size of a 0-length sparse integer vector has a size of `888 B`.

```{r}
obj_size(sparse_integer(integer(), integer(), length = 0))
```

This value is the same for any size of sparse vector, regardless of how long it is. This is happening because the sparse vectors only keep track of the non-default values.

```{r}
obj_size(sparse_integer(integer(), integer(), length = 0))
obj_size(sparse_integer(integer(), integer(), length = 1000))
obj_size(sparse_integer(integer(), integer(), length = 2000))
obj_size(sparse_integer(integer(), integer(), length = 3000))
```

## Keeping dense data in a sparse format

A dense integer vector will have the same size, regardless of what values it takes

```{r}
dense_x <- integer(1000)
obj_size(dense_x)

dense_x[1:100] <- 1:100
obj_size(dense_x)
```

The sparse integer counterpart on the other hand will increase for each non-default we need to store.

```{r}
sparse_x <- sparse_integer(integer(), integer(), 1000)
obj_size(sparse_x)

sparse_x <- sparse_integer(1:100, 1:100, 1000)
obj_size(sparse_x)

sparse_x <- sparse_integer(1:200, 1:200, 1000)
obj_size(sparse_x)
```

So it all comes down to a trade-off. Dense integer vectors with a size of 210 or less will be smaller than their sparse counterparts no matter what. Dense integer vector vectors with 211 elements will take up the same amount of memory as their sparse counterpart with no values.

From these values we can calculate memory equivalent vectors to determine which would be more efficient, noting that sparse vectors increase in size by twice for each non-default value that their dense counterpart. For a vector of length 1000, the sparse vector will be equivalent in size if it has `210` non-default values. And these values continue to go up.

## Conversion speed

As with everything in life, we have to deal with tradeoffs. The main tradeoff you will see in using this package is that memory allocation is minimized to allow for workflows not otherwise possible. With that in mind, there will be times when using these sparse vectors is not ideal. The main one is that converting back and forth between dense and sparse vectors takes a non-zero amount of time. Generally, you won't see any benefit if you are forced to materialize a sparse vector.

Below is one such example. both `dense_fun()` and `sparse_fun()` creates a numeric vector, with length `x`, with the value of `x` in the last element. Calling `[]` on an ALTREP vector forces it to materialize, so we now can look at how much slower it is to create the sparse vector and go back. 

```{r}
dense_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- numeric(x)
  res[x] <- x
  res
}

sparse_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- sparse_double(x, x, x)
  res[]
}

bench::press(
  x = c(10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000),
  {
    bench::mark(
      dense = dense_fun(x),
      sparse = sparse_fun(x)
    )
  }
) |>
  autoplot()
```

staying dense the whole time is faster no matter the speed.

As a comparison, we can look at how much time it takes if we don't force materialization. 

```{r}
dense_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- numeric(x)
  res[x] <- x
  res
}

sparse_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- sparse_double(x, x, x)
  res
}

bench::press(
  x = c(10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000),
  {
    bench::mark(
      dense = dense_fun(x),
      sparse = sparse_fun(x)
    )
  }
) |>
  autoplot()
```

What we are really seeing here is that creating a sparse vector takes a near-constant amount of time. So once the length is high enough it wins. But this by itself isn't a good comparison because these vectors are useless unless we do something with them. Where sparse vectors shine is when we can use sparse-aware methods. One such example are `min()`, `max()` and `sum()` for numeric ALTREP vectors. These functions have special hooks to trigger implementations that don't require materialization. They will thus do quite well.

```{r}
dense_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- numeric(x)
  res[x] <- x
  res
}

sparse_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- sparse_double(x, x, x)
  res
}

bench::press(
  x = c(10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000),
  {
    dense_x <- dense_fun(x)
    sparse_x <- sparse_fun(x)
    bench::mark(
      dense = sum(dense_x),
      sparse = sum(sparse_x)
    )
  }
) |>
  autoplot()
```

These functions do well because they calculate the sum over the non-default values instead of all values. For truly sparse vectors this will be fast. On the other hand, some methods don't have ALTREP support. Trying to use them triggers materialization to allow the calculations to progress. Once such unsupported method is `mean()`.

```{r}
dense_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- numeric(x)
  res[x] <- x
  res
}

sparse_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- sparse_double(x, x, x)
  res
}

bench::press(
  x = c(10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000),
  {
    dense_x <- dense_fun(x)
    sparse_x <- sparse_fun(x)
    bench::mark(
      dense = mean(dense_x),
      sparse = mean(sparse_x)
    )
  }
) |>
  autoplot()
```

And we see that the sparse is always slower. But this can be handled by doing sparse-aware calculations. The helper functions `sparse_positions()` and `sparse_values()` can be used in combination with other functions to work with sparse vectors without having to materialize them. Under the assumption that `default = 0`, we can write a mean method for sparse vectors as `sum(sparse_values(x)) / length(x)`. Using this formulation allows us to work fast again by avoiding materialization.

```{r}
dense_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- numeric(x)
  res[x] <- x
  res
}

sparse_fun <- function(x) {
  res <- sparse_double(x, x, x)
  res
}

sparse_mean <- function(x) {
  sum(sparse_values(x)) / length(x)
}

bench::press(
  x = c(10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000),
  {
    dense_x <- dense_fun(x)
    sparse_x <- sparse_fun(x)
    bench::mark(
      dense = mean(dense_x),
      sparse = sparse_mean(sparse_x)
    )
  }
) |>
  autoplot()
```

The ideal usage of sparse vectors is to keep them in a data.frame or tibble, and use `coerce_to_sparse_matrix()` at the end to create a sparse matrix that is understood by downstream functions.
